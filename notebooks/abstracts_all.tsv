jeanphilippe.beaulieu@utas.edu.au	Jean-Philippe	Beaulieu	University of Tasmania, Hobart	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Status report on the Ariel space mission	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	No	Talk		Ariel is the fouth M class mission from the European Space Agency due to launch late 2029. It is a 1m space telescope at L2 entirely dedicated to the observations of exoplanet atmospheres. Ariel will observe around a thousand transiting planets, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types. Ariel will use transit spectroscopy in the 1.1-7.8 μm spectral range and photometry in multiple narrow bands covering the optical and near-infrared (NIR). We will focus on warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials and thus reveal their bulk elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si). Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets will drive understanding of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular phase and the following few million years. Ariel will thus provide a complete picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets. I will present the status of the development of the Ariel space mission, discuss the evolution of the science case in the context of JWST, and the very important ground based work in preparation of the Ariel input catalogue.	
Hecsari.BelloMartinez@mq.edu.au	Hecsari	Bello Martinez	Macquire University	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Light Curve Analysis of Solar Analog Stars from Kepler: A Study Using Simple Python FFT Techniques	Poster	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Poster		This study analysed light curves for Kepler-75b, Kepler-84b, K00115.01, and K00760.03, retrieved from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using the transit method. Signal processing techniques, including normalization, smoothing, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), were employed to extract orbital periods and other physical parameters. The period estimates were found to be in close alignment with those reported in the literature, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the methods employed. The quality of the normalization process was identified as a critical factor in ensuring the accuracy of period determination, as evidenced by the analysis of Kepler-84b and K00115.01. Furthermore, the study emphasises the significance of accurate time measurement in light curve analysis, through the implementation of a concise Python routine, in order to guarantee reliable outcomes.	
nicholas.borsato@hdr.mq.edu.au	Nicholas	Borsato	Macquarie University & Lund University	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY	N/A	Sorting a Hot Mess: Decoding the 3-Dimensional Atmosphere of KELT-9b Using the Entire Visual Spectrum	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk	N/A	The properties of ultra-hot Jupiters are so extreme that they push the defining boundaries of what constitutes an exoplanet. Among these exoplanet outliers, KELT-9b is conspicuous as the most extreme: a tidally locked, heavily irradiated, evaporating exoplanet with the highest equilibrium temperature on record (~4000 K) – and an atmosphere highly suitable for transit studies. In this study, we combined 13 transit observations from six observing sites to search for atomic and ionised species in KELT-9b's atmosphere over a wavelength range of 316–950 nm. Utilising the cross-correlation function (CCF) as a forward model, we employed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling paired with bootstrapping techniques; bootstrapping, which involves repeatedly resampling data to estimate variability, allowed us to robustly fit velocity parameters for each detection. We aggregated all 13 nights of observations by constructing weights based on data quality, expected line depths, and model injection. Our comprehensive analysis resulted in the detection of 40 atomic and ionised species in KELT-9b's atmosphere. To interpret these detections, we built toy models to test the hypothesis that the species originate from different locations within the atmosphere, extending even to the planet's Roche lobe. We argue that KELT-9b's transmission spectrum exhibits properties attributable to an inflated dayside, with an extended atmosphere partially decoupled from the planet's interior atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that multiple cross-correlation detections can provide valuable insights into the atmospheric dynamics and geometrical properties of ultra-hot Jupiters.	
louis.desdoigts@gmail.com	Louis	Desdoigts	The University of Sydney	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Amigo: Differentiable modelling of JWST AMI mode	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	No	Talk		The Aperture Masking Interferometer (AMI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a unique place in observational astronomy as the first imaging interferometer in space, promising highly-precise observations resistant to optical aberrations. While the optical system and Point-Spread Function (PSF) are very stable, the infrared detectors on board suffer from a series of non-linearities – primarily charge migration or the “brighter-fatter effect” that, while challenging for other observing modes, are ruinous to the visibility calibration of the AMI mode. Local nonlinear effects produced cannot be straightforwardly corrected in the Fourier domain. Efforts using the existing pipelines have delivered some improvements, but outcomes remain far from the theoretical photon-noise limit of the instrument. This manuscript presents initial work using a fundamentally different approach: the joint implementation of a differentiable physics model of the optics, and a machine-learned Effective Detector Model (EDM), using dLux. These are trained together end-to-end, by gradient descent using the full ensemble of point-source reference targets so far observed by AMI. We infer highly- precise metrology of the AMI and NIRISS optical systems, a preliminary EDM which restores commissioning data to near-ideal precision, and illustrate initial and final residual noise floors representing the present state of this ongoing project.	
tyler.fairnington@gmail.com	Tyler	Fairnington	University of Southern Queensland	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		A Formation Dichotomy Revealed in the Eccentricity Distribution of TESS Warm Sub-Saturns	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		We present the eccentricity distribution of warm sub-Saturns (4-8 Re) in TESS, to reveal their formation pathways. Using the photoeccentric effect, we inferred eccentricities and the underlying population distributions of sub-Saturns with periods 8-200 days with Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling. Our models include both single and mixed distributions, reflecting potentially diverse formation pathways. Our resulting distribution suggests a mixed history: approximately 85% of warm sub-Saturns are on circular orbits, suggesting in-situ or disk formation, while the remaining 15% have high eccentricities (e>0.5), requiring formation via dynamical interactions and/or high eccentricity migration. We also find a lower fraction of eccentric sub-Saturns compared to Jovians. This suggests that larger planets form, and potentially interact with comparably massive planets.	
iainhammond97@gmail.com	Iain	Hammond	Monash University	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Three protoplanets in a Laplace resonace around PDS 70?	N/A	Yes, I have already registered		Poster		The disc around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent JWST/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ∼13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We present 11 years of near-IR observations of the disc in YJH, K and L'-bands. We use a combination of angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all eight epochs, consistent with the James Webb Space Telescope detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet in a 4:2:1 resonance with PDS 70 b & c. We find the spectrum is bluer compared to b and flat with respect to the star from 0.95–1.68µm. While we cannot definitively rule out a moving inner disc feature such as a spiral wake associated with b, this data lends support to the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.	
caitlyn.hardiman@monash.edu	Caitlyn	Hardiman	Monash University	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Constraining Turbulence in Protoplanetary Discs	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		High-resolution observations of protoplanetary discs offer a unique window into the early stages of planetary system formation. The interactions between forming planets and their surrounding discs can result in observable signatures, such as rings, gaps, and spiral structures, as well as deviations in the disc's kinematic structure. Recent advances in observation quality thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have significantly enhanced our ability to detect and characterise such features. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to constrain turbulence within these discs - a fundamental process influencing planet formation - by fitting radiative transfer models to raw visibility data from the exoALMA Large Program, with the aim of advancing our understanding of how baby planets can influence and be influenced by their birth environments.	
rachel.harrison@monash.edu	Rachel	Harrison	Monash University	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Dust Polarization Up Close and Personal in a Planet-Forming Disk	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		We present high-resolution ALMA observations of polarized emission in the protoplanetary disk HD 97048 at 870 $\mu$m. A previous study of gas kinematics in HD 97048 found evidence of a Jupiter-mass planet located between two dust rings. Constraining the dust grain properties in this disk therefore gives us insight into dust evolution at the time of planet formation. We observed polarized emission consistent with scattering (i.e., the scattering of thermal emission from dust grains by other dust grains) in the disk. The polarization fraction and angle are correlated with the disk's ring and gap substructure. The polarization fraction is higher in the gap and inner cavity than in the first ring, and the polarization angles are more azimuthally oriented in the gap while the polarization angle in the first ring is more parallel to the disk's minor axis. These changes in polarization fraction and angle are expected to arise from variations in optical depth and the direction of the radiation anisotropy within the disk. We model the expected polarization in this disk for dust grain populations with varying sizes and porosities, and discuss the implications for dust evolution this planet-forming disk.	
jonti.horner@unisq.edu.au	Jonti	Horner	UniSQ	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		The Search for the Inbetweeners: How packed are my TESS systems?	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		Over the last fifteen years, the number of known transiting exoplanets has risen dramatically, primarily as a result of two great space observatories: Kepler and TESS. Ongoing studies of the planetary systems discovered by those spacecraft have reveal that many host multiple planets - and there is a growing consensus that that trend will only become more pronounced as observatory facilities on Earth continue to push the search for alien worlds to ever smaller planets. A common theme among transiting exoplanet systems that host multiple planets is that those systems tend to be 'dynamically packed' - in other words, that the planets therein are so close to one another that there is no room for additional planets to exist on stable orbits between them. In this work, we examine seven planetary systems discovered by TESS that each contain two confirmed exoplanets. We ask the question 'Are these systems dynamically packed, or is there room for additional planets between those that have already been identified.'. To answer this question, we present the results of detailed and extensive suites of high-resolution n-body dynamical simulations that investigate the stability of hypothetical Earth-mass planets in these systems. Our results will help to direct the future search for additional planets around these stars, identifying those systems that are ideal targets for future follow-up work.	
skane@ucr.edu	Stephen	Kane	University of California, Riverside			10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Atmospheric Dynamics of a Near Tidally Locked Earth-Size Planet	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	No	Talk		The discovery and characterization of Earth-sized planets that are in, or near, a tidally-locked state are of crucial importance to understanding terrestrial planet evolution, and for which Venus is a clear analog. Exoplanetary science lies at the threshold of characterizing hundreds of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, thereby providing a statistical sample far greater than the limited inventory of terrestrial planetary atmospheres within the Solar System. However, the model-based approach for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres relies on Solar System data, resulting in our limited inventory being both foundational and critical atmospheric laboratories. Present terrestrial exoplanet demographics are heavily biased toward short-period planets, many of which are expected to be tidally locked, and also potentially runaway greenhouse candidates, similar to Venus. Here we describe the rise in the terrestrial exoplanet population and the study of tidal locking on climate simulations. These exoplanet studies are placed within the context of Venus, a local example of an Earth-sized, asynchronous rotator that is near the tidal locking limit. We describe the recent lessons learned regarding the dynamics of the Venusian atmosphere and how those lessons pertain to the evolution of our sibling planet. We discuss the implications of these lessons for exoplanet atmospheres and their detection with observations using JWST and other future facilities. We outline the crucial data that will be acquired from the coming Venus missions (DAVINCI, EnVision, VERITAS), and the need for further characterization of the Venusian climate in order to achieve a full and robust interpretation of terrestrial planetary atmospheres.	
b.mckee@unsw.edu.au	Brendan	McKee	UNSW	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Searching for Companions to Hot Jupiters		Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		Hot Jupiters are giant planets that orbit close to their host stars. Transit timing variations (TTVs) are deviations away from a constant orbital period. These may be due to interactions of the planet with the star, or with another planet in the system. Companions to hot Jupiters are rare, and searching for these TTVs may reveal otherwise hidden planets. The rate at which companions form will reveal the formation history of hot Jupiters.	
p.mistry@unsw.edu.au	Priyashkumar	Mistry	UNSW, Sydney	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Validation of eight potential super-earths from TESS data	N/A	Yes, I have already registered		Poster		NASA’s all-sky survey mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), is specifically engineered to detect exoplanets that transit bright stars. Thus far, TESS has successfully identified approximately 400 transiting exoplanets, in addition to roughly 6 000 candidate exoplanets pending confirmation. In this study, we present the results of our ongoing project, the Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST). Our dedicated effort is focused on the confirmation and characterisation of new exoplanets through the application of statistical validation tools. Through a combination of ground-based telescope data, high-resolution imaging, and the utilisation of the statistical validation tool known as TRICERATOPS, we have successfully discovered eight potential super-Earths. These planets bear the designations: TOI-238b (1.61 +0.09−0.10 R ⊕ ), TOI-771b (1.42 +0.11−0.09 R ⊕ ), TOI-871b (1.66 +0.11−0.11 R ⊕ ), TOI-1467b (1.83 +0.16−0.15 R ⊕ ), TOI-1739b (1.69 +0.10−0.08 R ⊕ ), TOI-2068b (1.82 +0.16−0.15 R ⊕ ), TOI-4559b (1.42 +0.13−0.11 R ⊕ ), and TOI-5799b (1.62 +0.19−0.13 R ⊕ ). Among all these planets, six of them fall within the region known as ‘keystone planets’, which makes them particularly interesting for study. Based on the location of TOI-771b and TOI-4559b below the radius valley we characterised them as likely super-Earths, though radial velocity mass measurements for these planets will provide more details about their characterisation. It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the evolutionary stages between Earth and Neptune.	
b.montet@unsw.edu.au	Ben	Montet	UNSW Sydney	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Searching for Circumbinary Planets via Apsidal Precession	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	No	Talk		Of the thousands of known exoplanets, only fifteen are circumbinary, oribiting two stars instead of one. All of these systems have been detected via transit photometry, which requires a low mutual inclination for all three objects to eclipse. However, over a long time baseline a wide planetary-mass companion to a binary system will induce orbital precession. We are conducting a search for planetary systems by identifying systems which have detectable apsidal precession over decades between observations with WASP, KELT, TESS, and others. I will present an overview of our survey, the first candidates, and future plans to confirm and characterise these potential planets.	
avamorrissey@gmail.com	Ava	Morrissey	University of Southern Queensland	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Searching for Escape	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		Understanding exoplanet atmospheres is crucial for comprehending the diversity of planetary systems. This study offers key insights into the formation of the radius gap observed in the small planet population. By investigating atmospheric mass loss in real-time, we aim to constrain the mechanisms driving atmospheric evaporation and the timescales over which they occur. Our research focuses on HIP 94235 b, a 120 Myr old sub-Neptune, 3 Earth radius planet on a close-in orbit around a Sun-like star. We conducted multiple observations using HST’s STIS and VLT’s CRIRES+ to search for signs of an evaporating atmosphere, utilising both hydrogen and helium tracers. This presentation outlines our findings from this multi-tracer approach to studying atmospheric escape.	
enabbie1@gmail.com	Emma	Nabbie	University of Southern Queensland	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Transit Timing Variations of TESS Multi-Planet Systems: A Catalog From the First Five Years	N/A	No, I will register at a later date	Yes	Talk		Transit Timing variations (TTVs) are a robust tool in measuring masses of otherwise-inaccessible planets to comprehensively probe a system’s architecture. TTVs directly constrain a multi-planet system’s dynamical history, as disk migration can produce planets in resonant orbits. We present the first results from our analysis of TTVs across 180 TESS multi-planet systems, with a focus on systems with at least one giant planet or with hosts brighter than Tmag = 12. Of the 22 systems hosting at least one giant planet, we report candidate TTV signals in 9 of them. The first of its kind, this catalog will improve upon the work of Kepler TTV catalogs, as TESS host stars are generally brighter than Kepler hosts. This increases the follow-up potential of these systems with other observation methods and enables confirmation of more tentative signals with ground-based observatories. Our catalog will facilitate future follow-up analyses of high-impact targets, such as the upcoming JWST target system TOI-1130, to connect their dynamical histories with current theories of planet formation.	
thomas.plunkett@utas.edu.au	Thomas	Plunkett	University of Tasmania	Student	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		TASSIE: a TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a nearly all-sky survey taking precise photometric measurements of millions of stars in our galaxy. It has become a powerful tool in the search for exoplanets, along with contributing to studies of stellar evolution through asteroseismology. By targeting bright stars amenable to radial velocity follow-up, the TESS mission aims to increase our statistical sample of exoplanets with accurate radius and mass measurements. It will also provide excellent targets for future atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. This will help to address outstanding issues in planet formation and evolution, such as testing classic core accretion and migration scenarios. TESS has already discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates across both celestial hemispheres, making these known to the public in the form of TESS Objects of Interest (TOI). However, we often need photometric and spectroscopic follow-up, combined with statistical tests, to validate a candidate as a true exoplanet rather than a false positive (such as an eclipsing binary). Whilst many facilities exist to perform follow-up measurements for stars visible from the Northern hemisphere, the same cannot be said about the Southern hemisphere. Tasmania is a unique location to perform follow-up, due to our mid Southern latitude and existing telescopic infrastructure. Over the Summer of 2023 to 2024, 5 TOIs classified as planetary candidates were observed with the new UTAS Harlingten 50cm telescope. In this talk, I will outline the analysis undertaken and present the validation of two short-period giant planets.

In particular I will discuss results of the exoALMA project to try to search for kinematic signatures of planets with the ALMA telescope, and possible hints of chemical changes induced by planets in discs and our attempts to model them.	
efstathia.rektsini@utas.edu.au	Natalia	Rektsini	University of Tasmania	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Cold Distant Worlds: A New Era of microlensing observations with ROMAN and EUCLID		Yes, I have already registered	No	Talk		Gravitational microlensing relies on the chance alignment of two or more stars in our galaxy. Over 200 planets have been found so far using this technique, in addition to several free-floating planet candidates, offering a small but diverse variety of planetary systems. In 2026 microlensing will enter a new observational era with the launching of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the first space mission to conduct a microlensing survey, promising to increase the detection number by a factor of ten. One of the limiting factors of microlensing planet searches is to obtain accurate mass measurements. An approach to break this limit is to use constraints from high angular resolution follow-up observations (with KECK and HST until now) to measure the source-lens relative proper motions and flux ratios. I will present results from follow-up AO observations of microlensing events, discussing various types of planetary systems, located in different corners of our galaxy. Finally, I will discuss the importance of a EUCLID and ROMAN collaboration. Using simulated early EUCLID images of a star field containing 403 microlensing events that ROMAN will observe, I will explain the complementarity of the two missions. I will show how EUCLID precursor observations of the ROMAN fields will maximise the number of source-lens resolved images, offering precise mass and distance measurements of these microlensing events, offering additional constraints in our understanding of cold and warm planet demographics and planetary formation theories.	
stephanie.rossini-bryson@sydney.edu.au	Stephanie	Rossini-Bryson	The University of Sydney	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		The GLINT instrument: high-contrast imaging of stellar companions using nulling interferometry.	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		Directly imaging habitable-zone exoplanets and analysing their spectra can reveal atmospheric compositions and potential biosignatures, making this endeavour a central goal in exoplanet science. However, separating the faint planetary light from its host star is extremely challenging, requiring high contrasts and tight angular separations. Nulling Interferometry offers a solution by destructively interfering light from an on-axis host star, while constructively interfering light from its companion, effectively ‘nulling out’ the starlight. The Guided Light Interferometric Nulling Technology (GLINT) instrument, downstream of the SCExAO system on the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope (Hawai’i, USA), performs nulling interferometry in the H-band. GLINT uses photonic technology with laser-inscribed waveguides to couple light within a glass chip and has previously resolved angular separations 2.5 times smaller than the telescope’s diffraction limit. Recently, GLINT underwent a major upgrade in its optical design and installation of a new chip to enhance sensitivity. This upgraded version of GLINT will be tested on-sky mid-September 2024, aiming to demonstrate its scalable capabilities for future use on larger-class telescopes and long-baseline interferometers. Here, we present an overview of the GLINT instrument, current achievements, and future endeavours.	
patryksan@gmail.com	Patryk	Sofia Lykawka	Kindai University (Japan)	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		Terrestrial planet and asteroid belt formation by Jupiter–Saturn chaotic excitation: A comprehensive dynamical model for the inner solar system	N/A	Yes, I have already registered		Poster		The Jupiter–Saturn chaotic excitation (JSCE) scenario offers a plausible explanation for several properties of the inner solar system. Still, simultaneously replicating the four terrestrial planets’ orbits/masses and the asteroid belt’s main properties remain elusive. Here, we investigated the simultaneous formation of the four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the asteroid belt in the context of the JSCE scenario. We found that our terrestrial systems satisfied several inner solar system constraints. An analysis of 37 optimally formed terrestrial planet systems allowed us to constrain the planets’ building blocks, accretion history, and other fundamental properties. First, the obtained terrestrial planets acquired orbits and masses very similar to those observed in our solar system. In addition, other key results include Moon-forming giant impacts occurring within ~60 Myr, terrestrial planets’ bombardment of late impactors represented by disk objects formed within 2 au, and bulk water acquired during the first 10–20 Myr of Earth’s formation. In particular, achieving Earth’s estimated bulk water content required the disk to initially contain sufficient water mass in objects beyond ~1–1.5 au. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Finally, our model asteroid belt explained the asteroid belt’s orbital structure, small mass, and taxonomy (S-, C- and D/P-types). The current asteroids represent a mixture of local asteroids that survived the dynamical depletion of the primordial asteroid belt by JSCE and captured asteroids from trans-Jovian reservoirs during the giant-planet instability/migration.	
thygesen@msu.edu	Erica	Thygesen	Michigan State University	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		The K2 & TESS Synergy: Uniting NASA’s Planet Hunters		Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		The early success of JWST provides an exceptional opportunity to study the atmospheres of exoplanets with unprecedented detail. However, most (> 80%) confirmed transiting exoplanets will not be accessible to JWST during the mission’s lifetime. This widespread problem is due mostly to ephemeris degradation: uncertainties on transit time and period compound over time, which can culminate in predicted future transits being off by hours to days when targeting planets years later. With this in mind, I am leading the K2 & TESS Synergy, a large-scale effort to reanalyze all ~300 systems originally discovered by NASA’s K2 mission with new observations from TESS. We are combining light curves from both missions along with archival radial velocities, Gaia parallaxes, and spectral energy distributions in global fits which will not only allow us to update the ephemerides, but also build a self-consistent homogeneous catalog of system parameters for future population studies. We have now made ~75 K2 planetary systems accessible to JWST (including the top 50 transmission spectroscopy targets) through the inclusion of new TESS observations, and identified multiple systems with incorrect transit ephemerides due to systematics in the discovery observations. I will discuss the impact of these results for future characterization efforts, our recent effort to recover the lost ephemeris of K2’s first exoplanet discovery, and our plans to have the full K2 catalog reanalysis completed within the next two years. Efforts like the K2 and TESS Synergy will ensure the accessibility of transiting planets for future characterization while leading to a self-consistent catalog of stellar and planetary parameters for future population efforts.	
sydney.vach@unisq.edu.au	Sydney	Vach	UniSQ	Student	Woman	10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop ONLY		The occurrence and evolution of short-period, small planets younger than 1 Gyr	N/A	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Talk		We present the occurrence rates and evolution in radius and orbital properties of short-period small planets within their first billion years. We present evidence that young planets around FGK stars contract rapidly during the first 200 million years, and that population matches the Kepler demographic at the 500 Myr to 1 Gyr timescale. Our young planet population study helps to break the decade-old degeneracy between gas-rich and water-rich super-Earths and sub-Neptune interior models. Our results are most consistent with small close-in planets around FGK stars being formed gas-rich with puffy hydrogen-helium envelopes, juxtaposing ocean-world models that are largely steady-state in radius over this same timeframe. For the <200 Myr population, we measure an occurrence rate for mini- and super-Neptunes of 22%(+8.6/-6.8) and 13%(+4.9/-3.9) respectively, an overabundance compared to the mature Kepler distribution at the >2.5 sigma level. This overabundance disappears at the ~500 Myr timescale (<1 sigma level) as the planet population evolves to match the observed demographics of the Kepler yield.

This work seeks to assess the evolutionary influence on the presence of stellar companions and planetary companions on the formation evolution of planetary systems. Built on a sample of nearly 300 FGK stars that were systematically surveyed for both stellar companions and giant planets, our work uses TESS light curves to determine the rotation periods of stars in an effort to address how the presence of stellar and/or planetary companions can affect the angular momentum distribution within the systems. The comparison will be used to search for and characterise similarities and differences that may provide clues to the understanding of planetary formation and evolution in single and multiple star systems. We will focus on comparing the rotation periods of single stars known to host planets and not known to host planets to those of multiple stars known to host planets and not known to host planets. In particular, the angular momentum distribution of stellar systems (as measured by rotation periods of stars and orbital motion of the planets, if present) may be substantially different in planet-hosting stars as compared to non-planet hosting stars – or in comparison to multiple stars with or without planets.

j.bailey@unsw.edu.au	Jeremy	Bailey	UNSW	Retired	Man	BOTH workshops	Outbursts of the Be Star Eta Centauri	Polarization of the Solar System observed with PICSARR	Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	Poster	Many B stars eject material to form a decretion disk of gas around the star. The disks around these Be stars are observable through their strong emission lines, particularly at H-alpha, and through the polarization of their scattered light. What causes these stars to eject material is not understood. In some Be stars the ejection of material is in the form of outbursts. We have discovered that the bright star Eta Centauri is one of the most extremely variable examples of such objects. We will present the results of extensive polarization observations of this star over 5 years, and show how these observations can provide information on the mass ejection process and the evolution of the disk through the outburst cycle.	Observations of the polarization of extrasolar planets are a potential method of atmopheric characterization and searching for habitability and life. We have recently been using our PICSARR polarimeters to take new sets of polarization observations of a wide range of solar system objects (planets, satellites and asteroids) with higher precision than most previous studies. Here we will present results that compare the polarization properties of rocky and icy surfaces and planets with extensive atmospheres and comment on the applicability of such methods to exoplanets.

Its newly incorporated ability to perform simultaneous photometry of one target with four separate telescopes effectively samples entirely independent atmospheric cells for a fourfold reduction in scintillation. This upgrade provides a combined photometric precision comparable to large ground-based telescopes as demonstrated by the recent detection of a 1.0 R_Earth planet. We present a demonstration of the array’s sensitivity and recent observations of precise transit times and transit light-curve analyses of some of these high-value TESS candidates. By working towards the TFOP SG1 goals of identifying false positives and transit timing variations, and refining ephemerides, MINERVA-Australis is poised to recover the signals of and hence identify planets most amenable for further follow-up by JWST and the ELTs.

Their X-ray luminosity can shed light on galactic star formation rate and histories. Compact objects are also crucial in the evolution of gravitational wave progenitors. Here we present the results from our work to extend the binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) code to incorporate X-ray emission onto compact remnants in binary systems. We self-consistently model the accretion disc for each interacting binary system in a grid of stellar evolution models and then combine these to obtain the total X-ray spectra for stellar populations over a range of ages and metallicities. Crucially, these are estimated using the same stellar models as those used for modelling the stellar spectral energy distribution. We utilise first principle equations to calculate the X-ray binary (XRB) evolution, luminosity and spectral energy densities of individual accreting compact objects.	For the upcoming ESA PLATO satellite mission, a large number of target stars are required to yield a statistically significant number of planet transits. Locating the long-duration observational phase (LOP) fields closer to the Galactic plane will increase the target star numbers but also the astrophysical false positives (FPs) from blended eclipsing binary systems. Here I present the results of the analysis of a synthetic rendering of the long-duration observational phase South (LOPS) field carried out as Post-Doc project for the ESA mission consortium.

This research will enhance our understanding of how activity cycle periods relate to rotation rates in fast-rotating stars. We measured activity cycles for 138 G–K-type main sequence stars using combined time-series photometry spanning ~14 years. The first set of 70 stars used non-overlapping time-series data from the Kepler Full Frame Images (FFIs), All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the second set of 68 stars used data from Kepler-FFIs–ZTF. Additionally, we measured the activity cycles for 25 RS Cannum Venaticorum (RS CVn) candidates. For our sample, we also examined whether the observed flux variations correlated or anti-correlated with the photospheric activity due to the presence of faculae or starspots.

Our findings reveal that fast-rotating G–K-type stars show no strong correlation between cycle length and rotation period.

We study the complex dynamics of stellar triples and their coupling to stellar evolution. We examine how the orbital evolution affects the inner binary's stellar evolution and interaction and estimate the rates for stellar mergers, collisions and observable transients. For massive compact stellar triples, we find that a significant fraction could merge either on the main sequence or after the inner binary has collapsed into binary black-holes, generating a gravitational-wave merger event. For low and intermediate-mass stars, we find that wide stellar triples could be perturbed by the galactic tide and acquire extremely highly-eccentric orbits. In turn, stellar inspirals and collisions could dominate the collisional field population in generating field blue stragglers, proto-cataclysmic variables and double red-giant collisions and contribute to double white-dwarf collisions and type Ia Supernova progenitors.	Hot Jupiters (HJ) are gas giant planets with approximately Jovian masses orbiting their host star with short orbital periods of just a few days. Their ubiquity challenges the current formation channels. HJ most likely formed elsewhere and migrated either in a disc or via high-eccentricity migration and tidal circularisation. Moreover, the significant obliquity angle (the angle between the stellar spin and planetary orbit) suggests that high-eccentricity migration is prevalent. We show that the eccentricity of the proto-HJ can be efficiently pumped by the Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanism in the presence of an outer binary star. When the stellar binary is ultra-wide, it can be perturbed by the Galactic tidal field. We show that this 'wide-binary' channel is more efficient than the standard LK mechanism due to the chaotic dynamics experienced at a wide range of mutual inclinations. Using the current available wide-binary catalogue from GAIA we will estimate the formation rate of HJ from this channel.

We extracted super-resolution maps of velocity substructures in 12CO line emission for exoALMA and created a general method for calculating robust uncertainties on other data products. For the LVM we modelled the contributions from many spectral lines together to create intensity maps across the sky for each, which will be valuable for determining how energy and momentum is distributed and transported through the galaxy on both small and large scales.

These stars provide critical insights into AGB nucleosynthesis, dredge-up events, and hot-bottom burning. However, the mechanisms driving the observed diversity in their chemical signatures remain uncertain. In this talk, I will explore both observational and modelling perspectives on s-process and carbon-enriched post-AGB stars. I will also discuss our recent discovery of the most carbon-rich and s-process enhanced post-AGB star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). High-resolution optical spectroscopy with VLT/UVES has revealed this star's exceptionally high C/O ratio and a significant enhancement of s-process elements, including the first-ever precise measurement of lead (Pb) abundance, the final product of the s-process nucleosynthesis. These results challenge existing nucleosynthesis models and set a new benchmark for understanding how mass loss rates and mixing processes shape the chemical evolution of evolved stars.

Previous widefield radio surveys have typically consisted of only a few epochs (or a single epoch), which has limited our ability to distinguish stellar emission from background AGN. As a result it has been difficult to constrain population statistics such as the surface density and fraction of the population producing radio emission in a particular variable or spectral class. The Australian SKA pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope is transforming our understanding of radio star populations. For the first time we are able to monitor hundreds (and potentially 1000s) of stars at gigahertz radio frequencies. We can investigate timescales as short as seconds, with monitoring periods over months to years. In this talk I will present some of our results, including recently published work in which we monitor a sample of radio stars detected in circular polarisation searches of the multi-epoch ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients survey. Based on this work we anticipate detecting several hundred new radio stars for each year of our ASKAP survey, and tens of thousands in next generation all-sky surveys with the Square Kilometre Array. I will also discuss the prospects for current and future radio stars studies with ASKAP and the SKA, and potential for multi-wavelength collaborations.

However, it is unclear whether this diversity stems from a distribution of initial conditions, and/or the result of multiple planet formation pathways. It is therefore fundamental to detect young, embedded planets during the process of formation. While the planets likely remain hidden by the disk at near-infrared wavelengths, they leave clear signatures in the velocity field in their vicinity, which can be detected with line observations with ALMA. This led to the developement of the "disk kinematic" planet detection method in the last 5 years, and offers a unique opportunity to probe the distribution of planets at the extreme earliest stages of their formation. In this contribution, we present the results of the exoALMA planet-hunting campaign that targeted 15 protoplanetary disks with deep, high spatial, and high spectral resolution observations line observations. We will discuss our planet detection statistics, the constraints we can place on these youngest planets, and their implication for the planet formation pathways, as well as our new kinematic view of the physical processes at play during planet formation.

The Sun is so far the only isolated main sequence star detected in gamma-rays, and is particularly bright during powerful flares. Young dwarf stars of K-type and later are far more magnetically active than the Sun, which makes them excellent candidates for gamma-ray searches. With over 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we analysed the phase-folded light curve of the fast-rotating radio M9 star TVLM 513-46546 and reported a tentative detection of a gamma-ray pulse associated with its rotation. This is the first detection of an isolated main-sequence star in gamma-rays. We also stack Fermi-LAT data during flare events identified from radio, optical and X-ray flare surveys for K-type and later dwarf stars. This stacking survey indicates an upper limit of gamma-ray emission from the population of flare stars. The stellar gamma-ray emission likely originates from the decay of neutral pions generated by relativistic protons interacting within the stellar atmosphere. These gamma-ray observations can be used to constrain the particle acceleration mechanisms and the resulting stellar energetic particle spectrum. Extrapolating the GeV emission enables the estimation of TeV detectability with the Cherenkov Telescope Array. The estimated magnitude of these flares and the associated stellar winds and coronal mass ejections can be compared to the Solar flares that cause extreme geomagnetic events on Earth. Frequent, repeated events would then likely evaporate parts or all of the exoplanet atmosphere hence decreasing its long-term habitability. This impact is being examined through detailed photochemical evolution models of exoplanet atmosphere PHOTOCHEM.	Many occurrences in the early stages of planet formation can impact the fate of the system. In this work, we explore how stellar multiplicity affects mature planetary systems, e.g., whether close-in stellar companions inhibit planet formation or alter planet properties. The volume-limited Pervasive Overview of "Kompanions" of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) survey has used speckle imaging to measure the stellar multiplicity of 455 M dwarfs within 15 pc. These observations have revealed that planet-hosting M-dwarf multiples have much larger separations than non-planet-hosting multiples. In this work, we will use REBOUND – an N-body integrator – to model the dynamical evolution of planetary systems in multi-star systems. These simulations will help us determine whether the trend revealed by the POKEMON survey is an observational effect or empirical evidence for the impact of stellar companions on planet formation.

In rare binary systems Wolf-Rayet stars can form colliding-wind binaries in which the collision of hot stellar winds produce dust plumes sculpted into the beautifully elegant Pinwheel Nebulae in the shape of an Archimedean spiral. These objects encode a wealth of key physics governing winds and mass loss for objects that, despite thei rarity, drive processes of profound cosmic significance (for example dominating chemical enrichment in the early universe). With new data now streaming from powerful new facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope, a handful are found to be adorned with intricate celestial sculptures spun from stardust. True to form, the Wolf-Rayets have once again stolen the show.	The TOLIMAN mission will fly a low-cost space telescope designed and led from the University of Sydney. Its primary science targets an audacious outcome in planetary astrophysics: an exhaustive search for temperate-orbit rocky planets around either star in the Alpha Centauri AB binary, our nearest neighbour star system. By performing narrow-angle astrometric monitoring of the binary at extreme precision, any exoplanets betray their presence by gravitationally, engraving a tell-tale perturbation on the orbit. Recovery of this challenging signal, only of order micro-arcseconds of deflection, is normally thought to require a large (meter-class) instrument. By implementing significant innovations optical and signal encoding architecture, the TOLIMAN space telescope aims to recover such signals with a telescope aperture of only a 12.5cm. Here we describe the key features of the mission: its optics, signal encoding and the 16U CubeSat spacecraft bus in which the science payload is housed - all of which are now under construction. With science operations forecast on a timescale of a year, TOLIMAN aims to determine if the Sun's nearest neighbour hosts a potential planetary stepping stone into the galaxy. Success would lay down a visionary challenge for futuristic high speed probe technologies capable of traversing the interstellar voids.

It is known that the sample of white dwarf companions to solar-type stars (known as Sirius-like systems) is highly incomplete even in local space. However, these systems give us unparalleled information on stellar evolution and white dwarf physics. I will present results of a dedicated effort to discover and characterise new Sirius-like systems in the solar neighbourhood. We assemble the first majority-complete sample of Sirius-like systems within the 40 parsec volume, providing us the clearest picture of white dwarfs in multiple systems to date. A key discovery from this search is the first Sirius-like white dwarf confirmed to be undergoing crystallisation, which highlights the potential of multiple-star systems for making new constraints on white dwarf physics. I will then discuss avenues for future work in rounding out the sample of local Sirius-like systems.	White dwarfs are the end-state for the vast majority of stars in the Universe, yet very little is known about their planets. The unparalleled mid-infrared sensitivity of JWST has opened up the possibility of direct detection of planets orbiting white dwarfs across the solar neighbourhood for the first time. I will present the first discoveries from a planet-hunting survey of nearby white dwarfs with JWST, including an unresolved planet candidate detected from excess thermal emission. I will then present results from a targeted search for planets around one of the youngest white dwarfs in the solar vicinity, and will highlight the potential for direct study of small exoplanets around white dwarfs. These observations bring into focus the evolution of planetary systems beyond the deaths of their stars for the first time.

This process has a long-lasting impact on key stellar properties like mass and rotation rate, and it shapes the structure of the inner disk at the epoch of planet formation and migration. A key parameter to predict the evolution of the star-disk system is the radial distance between the stellar surface and the inner disk edge, which sets a physical limit to the innermost planets’ orbits. However, the location of this inner disk radius is hard to constrain observationally, for all except the closest young stars. Here, I discuss a first, widely-accessible photometric diagnostics to infer the inner disk structure around individual young stars by combining time domain measurements of stellar luminosities at optical and near-ultraviolet wavelengths with state-of-the-art simulations of disk accretion onto young stars. I also present the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE), a new NASA Small Explorer mission concept that is being developed by an international team of researchers between the USA, Europe, and Australia. Dedicated to polychromatic time domain surveys of young star clusters, EVE will investigate the earliest stages in the co-evolution of stars and planets, to determine the role played by disk accretion in setting stellar activity levels and the early architecture of planetary systems.

From this, we can measure parallax and proper motion to high degrees of accuracy. However, if a star is orbited by an unseen companion, the track is slightly distorted leading to a potentially inaccurate calculation of the system’s proper motion and parallax. This discrepancy is quantified by the renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) reported in the Gaia catalogue. The higher the RUWE, the greater the discrepancy. Using Bayesian inference with pystan, we use this error and the fitted track parameters to constrain the nature of a potential binary system using data from Gaia’s DR3. From this, it is possible to calculate the true parallax and proper motion of the system. I apply this method to several examples ranging from brown dwarf companions to main sequence binaries to black holes. Finally, I demonstrate the extra potential this method has when epoch data is released in DR4.	Astrometry with Gaia holds a unique place among planet detection methods, being most sensitive to periods comparable to gas giants in our solar system. Jupiter analogues in nearby systems have been shown to affect a star’s position enough to cause a discrepancy between the measured position and the fitted track. This discrepancy is quantified by the renormalised unit weight error (RUWE) reported in the Gaia catalogue. Higher values of RUWE indicate greater discrepancy and are strongly dependent on a planet’s mass and period. Using Bayesian inference with pystan, we use this error and the fitted track parameters to constrain the nature of nearby exoplanet systems. I show how this method can be combined with radial velocity data to constrain mass and inclination and how the release of epoch data Gaia DR4 will allow us to characterise potential Jupiter analogues in nearby systems. Finally, I show how future advances in direct imaging, when combined with astrometry will place better constraints on giant planet formation.

Its stellar parameters (Teff = 5729 +\- 13 K, logg = 4.54 +\- 0.01 dex, [Fe/H] = 0.002 +\- 0.010 dex, vt= 1.08 +\- 0.02 km/s) and chemical composition were determined via spectroscopic equilibrium using high resolution spectra (R = 60 000-165 000). The age of HIP 8522 was estimated at ~0.5 Gyr through isochrone fitting and was further confirmed using age-chemical clock relationships. Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at ~670.78 nm yielded a lithium abundance A(Li)~0.4 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have A(Li) values ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 dex, suggesting that ~2 dex of lithium is missing. We explore several scenarios, including planet engulfment, substellar mergers, overshooting, and the formation of blue stragglers. However, episodic accretion affecting the internal structure of young low-mass stars provides a viable explanation for the highly depleted lithium. HIP 8522 represents a potentially groundbreaking discovery, offering what could be the first observational evidence of early accretion. This star provides an exceptional opportunity to rigorously test stellar evolution models and gain crucial insights into the internal mixing mechanisms responsible for the significant destruction of lithium.	Older, metal-poor thick disc stars provide a unique environment for planet formation, differing significantly from the metal-rich thin disc stars. Despite this, only 26 exoplanets have been discovered around 14 thick disc stars so far, underscoring their rarity. I present the discovery of new exoplanetary systems orbiting stars in the thick disc. Membership in the thick disc was determined using kinematic data, along with [α/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] ratios. Stellar parameters and chemical composition were estimated spectroscopically using high-resolution HARPS spectra. In this talk, I will discuss how precise chemical composition measurements, at the level of 0.02 dex, could enhance our understanding of planet formation in the Milky Way's thick disc.

Work done by S5 has explored stream membership, orbit models and progenitors in detail. S5 also takes high resolution follow-up spectra for confirmed stream members to analyze their detailed properties and better understand the evolutionary histories of progenitor dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. I will present an in-depth study and comparison of two metal-poor, distant stellar streams originally identified in the Dark Energy Survey: Elqui and Turranburra – the latter named after Sydney’s Lane Cove River. Both dwarf galaxy streams are rather distant, with Elqui at a Galactocentric distance of 52 kpc and Turranburra at 28 kpc. In previous work, both streams have been found to have high velocity dispersions and low mean metallicities, implying that their progenitors were relatively low-mass dwarf galaxies.Through studying the dynamics and properties of these two streams, we are increasing our understanding of the accretion history of the Milky Way, as well shedding light on the broader processes that shape galaxy formation in general.

I present a study of the young solar analogue V889 Her, providing the first evidence of an altered solar-like magnetic dynamo operating within a young Sun-like star. We monitored the evolution of surface activity and the large-scale magnetic field between 2004 and 2019 using Doppler Imaging (DI), Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and chromospheric CaII H&K emissions. The large-scale magnetic field appears to undergo 3-4 yr fluctuations, evolving from weak and simple during activity minima to strong and complex during activity maxima, but without the global magnetic polarity reversals observed for more mature stars. Additionally, we assessed the effectiveness of DI in modelling radial velocity variations induced by magnetic activity, and established realistic detection limits for exoplanets in the presence of the extreme stellar activity of young Suns.		
sven.buder@anu.edu.au	Sven	Buder	Australian National University	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The power and challenges of stellar spectroscopy in the next decade		Talk	No, I will register at a later date			Stellar spectroscopy provides us with invaluable insights into the chemical composition and evolutionary histories of stars, unlocking the secrets of galaxies on larger scales. Yet, as our datasets grow exponentially, our current focus has shifted towards quantity and coverage, sometimes at the expense of quality. Our models also often struggle to fully capture the complexities of stellar atmospheres and line formation, particularly as stars evolve. This limits our ability to better understand the intricate details of stellar evolution. These challenges are magnified when transitioning from resolved stellar spectroscopy to unresolved systems, where less advanced tools constrain our interpretations of extragalactic observations. In this talk, I will explore the cutting-edge developments in stellar spectroscopy, emphasizing the critical gaps in our models and how they hinder our understanding of stellar and galactic evolution. I will also highlight the potential of ongoing missions like Gaia, GALAH, SDSS-V, and the extragalactic GECKOS project, alongside upcoming facilities such as 4MOST. These instruments promise to revolutionize our ability to probe stellar populations, but achieving the next breakthrough will require a shift toward higher-quality, more precise observations. I’ll conclude by discussing the path forward, bridging the gap between stellar theory and observations, and addressing the biggest unanswered questions in the subfield of stellar spectroscopy.

courtney.crawford@sydney.edu.au	Courtney	Crawford	University of Sydney	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The Kepler Secondary Clump Stars-- the amplitude-activity relation, potential binary indicators, and a high-velocity star		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes		The Kepler sample of oscillating red giants has advanced our understanding of low to intermediate-mass stars, though most studies have focused on low-mass stars. This talk presents research on high-mass red giants, specifically secondary clump stars. Many of these stars show suppressed dipole modes, potentially indicating strong internal magnetic fields. However, spectroscopy reveals no correlation between surface chromospheric activity (S-index) and dipole mode suppression. Instead, a stronger S-index is linked to weaker radial modes, which are localised to the star's surface. This is the first direct evidence that chromospheric activity can suppress overall oscillation strength, and also may suggest that internal and surface magnetic fields in red giants are not necessarily correlated. We also explore the possibility of binary interactions but find no strong candidates. Additionally, we identify a secondary clump star kinematically consistent with the Galactic Halo despite its young age and high metallicity, possibly ejected from a triple system early in its life. Future work will use these stars to test scaling relations at the high-mass end of red giants through individual frequency modelling of their oscillations.

To be properly studied, the emission from planetary nebulae must be described, accounting for interstellar extinction. Unfortunately, conventional methods of estimating extinction to PNe are not in good agreement. The advent of Gaia has made possible the systematic identification of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN). We suggest using these CSPN to gauge the interstellar extinction to their associated PNe. We have used the PySSED program to collate photometry measurements from available stellar sky surveys, producing SEDs of the CSPN. We demonstrate that the intrinsic shape of CSPN spectra has a weak dependence on temperature and composition, so any deviation from the standard spectral shape can be attributed to interstellar dust extinction. We can therefore use our SEDs to fit extinction values to planetary nebulae. We find that our results are in good agreement with those from dust maps, with greater resolution and more sensitivity to higher extinction values.		
taissa.danilovich@monash.edu	Taissa	Danilovich	Monash University	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The secrets of intermediate-mass AGB stars unveiled through astrochemistry		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	The AGB phase is one of the later stages of stellar evolution for low and intermediate mass stars, during which stars expel a large portion of their stellar envelope. Observations of molecular lines allow us to study the circumstellar material around AGB stars, from which we can derive mass-loss rates and study the chemistry of dust formation. Previous studies of the molecules in AGB stellar winds found that several molecules have strong dependences on the mass-loss rate or the density of the wind, showing either different abundances or distributions with wind density. Other molecules are only present if there is a stellar companion affecting the wind chemistry with its UV light. To explore these phenomenon further, we examined the molecular emission around two of the highest mass-loss rate AGB stars that have been observed with ALMA. Both stars are also known to have intermediate initial masses (~4 to 8 solar masses). In addition to several expected molecules, we found a large number of emission lines coming from the salt molecules NaCl and KCl. I will discuss these findings and their implications for the chemistry and physics of the circumstellar environments of these stars.		
barnali.das@csiro.au	Barnali	Das	CSIRO	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	VAST-MeMeS: a project to characterize radio emission from magnetic hot stars. 		Talk - SiB	Yes, I have already registered	Yes		Magnetic hot stars are unique objects on the main-sequence that have large-scale magnetic fields of kG strength, which are stable throughout their lifetimes. Such characteristics make them ideal celestial laboratories to investigate magnetospheric physics. The magnetospheres of these stars emit over a wide range of frequencies including radio. The radio emission is non-thermal in nature and can be incoherent or coherent. While a lot of efforts have gone into characterizing these emission, especially in the optical band, characterization of their radio emission is yet to be accomplished. This is a critical limitation since radio is the primary magnetospheric signatures for magnetic late B and A type stars. Radio is also the band at which a number of similarities are observed between hot stars and cool stars/brown dwarfs with large-scale magnetic fields. The primary obstacle in characterzing radio emission is the small size of the sample of known radio-bright magnetic hot stars. In my talk, I will present the 'VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' (VAST-MeMeS) that aims to take advantage of the enormous amount of radio data that the ASKAP telescope is collecting, in order to overcome this problem and answer key questions such as the driver of non-thermal emission. I will present our initial results and their implications towards recently reported model of radio emission from magnetic hot stars.		
pradoshbarun.das@hdr.mq.edu.au	Pradosh Barun	Das	Macquarie University	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Deriving Stellar Parameters and abundances: Employing “The Cannon” to Bridge GALAH-DR4 to GAIA-RVS Spectra		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	The enormous spectroscopic datasets from current astronomical surveys provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore the stellar populations of the Milky Way and its surroundings. The largest surveys range from several million stars (e.g., LAMOST) to the roughly quarter-billion stars observed with Gaia XP spectra. These survey data are generally at low or moderate spectroscopic resolutions, yet the “gold standard” for determining stellar parameters and elemental abundances remains high-resolution spectroscopic data. We have used The Cannon, a largely Australian-developed, data-driven method to transfer labels from high-resolution reference data to lower-resolution data, specifically applying stellar parameters and abundances derived from GALAH data (GALAH iDR4) to Gaia RVS spectra (Gaia DR3). We trained our data model on ~14000 selected targets common to both surveys, utilising the stellar labels from GALAH. With this model, we are able to consistently predict stellar parameters such as Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and abundances of several alpha elements for over 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. Using stars from several open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue, we have validated our metallicity estimates. Finally, for a subset of this sample with predicted log g < 3.5 (i.e., giants) we are able to measure the abundances of several neutron-capture elements, illustrating the exciting potential of this method for reliably determining stellar parameters and abundances from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra – a dataset which, by the end of the Gaia mission, is expected to include over 30 million stars.		
idavis@caltech.edu	Ivey	Davis	California Institute of Technology	Student	Gender fluid/Non-binary	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	A system for multi-wavelength monitoring of space weather from young, sun-like stars		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Space weather involves studying both the radiation from events like flares as well as the particles accelerated by the flare in the form of stellar energetic particle (SEP) events and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While there is observational evidence supporting the idea that the stellar radiation environment plays a significant role in the habitability and atmospheric content of exoplanets, we know from solar system bodies that the stellar particle flux should also be important. A part of understanding stellar space weather requires dedicated monitoring of individual stars across a variety of wavelengths to guarantee observing both a flare and the related particle acceleration. However, coordinating long-term, simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations is notoriously difficult. Here, I present the start of a pan-chromatic system dedicated to nightly monitoring of a sample of solar-type stars in order to detect flares and associated SEP and CME signatures. This system currently includes Flarescope operating at 400-550nm to look for flares and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) operating at 13-86MHz to look for radio signatures of CMEs and SEPs. This work includes a recently completed 200-hr campaign by Flarescope and the OVRO-LWA on the young G-dwarf EK Dra.		
richard.de-grijs@mq.edu.au	Richard	de Grijs	Macquarie University	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Hierarchical star formation in the local Universe		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	We investigate the hierarchical architecture of star formation in the Magellanic Clouds and contrast our results with recently obtained Galactic star-formation properties. We show that the morphologies of hierarchically nested clusters become increasingly round as we progress to smaller spatial scales, and that this trend reflects a real change in morphology rather than observational artifacts. We propose that this trend reflects young stellar populations transitioning from the fractal state characteristic of newly formed stellar ensembles to the dynamically relaxed state that characterises older bound stellar populations, including open and globular clusters. We find that our hierarchical cluster sample transitions to a dynamically relaxed state at a characteristic size scale of approximately 0.80 pc and a characteristic free-fall time of ≤ 2 Myr. In addition, we explore the clustering properties and stellar luminosity functions of the young, main-sequence stellar populations. Our analysis allows us to conclude that the observed hierarchy is driven by supersonic turbulence.		
c.deagan@unsw.edu.au	Conaire	Deagan	UNSW	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Mapping stellar surfaces with high-precision astrometry		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Mapping stellar surfaces is important for understanding stellar activity and its implications. Accurate localisation and temporal tracking of large-scale magnetic surface features, such as starspots and plages, can provide insights into stellar dynamos, differential rotation, and other phenomena. Traditionally, stellar surface mapping has relied on interferometry or light curve inversion techniques. However, recent work has demonstrated fundamental limitations in light curve inversion methods, including the ability to model any light curve with a two-spot model and the retrieval of, at best, only 50% of the surface information—often much less. This work demonstrates that high-precision astrometry offers a superior alternative for stellar surface mapping of nearby stars. Our approach not only yields more comprehensive information about stellar surfaces but also achieves finer “resolution” compared to traditional methods. This new mapping technique can improve our understanding of stellar activity and evolution, paving the way for more accurate models of stellar behaviour and structure.

We discovered 53 new binaries and present orbital parameters and mass functions for 24 systems. For the brightest star in our sample Alpha Pictoris, we perform a joint fit of the pulsation timing and Hipparcos astrometry. We present the first orbit for the Alpha Pictoris system, obtaining a period of 1300 days and component masses for both stars. We revisit Kepler pulsation timing binaries with Gaia kinematics, finding four systems in the Galactic thick disk/halo. This suggests that they have been rejuvenated by mass transfer, and their companions are now white dwarfs. Further follow-up may constrain the galactic blue straggler population. We demonstrate promise for the detection of brown dwarfs and exoplanets with this technique in the future of TESS.		
Laura.driessen@sydney.edu.au	Laura	Driessen	The University of Sydney	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue: a new catalogue of radio stars		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	I will present a new catalogue of 839 radio stars detected <3 GHz: the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC). Most of these stars were identified using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The ASKAP stars in the SRSC were found using a range of techniques: circular polarisation searches, proper-motion searches, variability searches and multiwavelength cross-matching. We have also included published radio stars from e.g. MeerKAT and V-LoTSS in the SRSC. The catalogue contains stars from across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, from ultra-cool dwarfs to blue supergiants to Wolf Rayets. The previous best-known radio star catalogue, the Wendker catalogue, contained 228 radio stars detected <3 GHz. Hence the SRSC is a big leap forward in our understanding of the population and characteristics of radio stars. I will present an overview of the SRSC catalogue, including the search methods, the properties and types of stars, the X-ray-radio characteristics using eROSITA_DE observations, and the circular polarisation properties. I will also highlight some individual objects of particular interest.		
anuj.gautam@unisq.edu.au	Anuj	Gautam	University of Southern Queensland	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Quantifying Systematic Uncertainties in δ Sct Star Modelling for Asteroseismic Age-dating		Talk	Missed the registration deadline	Yes		Determining accurate stellar ages has implications for various areas of astrophysics, from understanding our Galaxy’s chemical evolution to refining models of protoplanetary disc formation and evolution. However, stellar ages cannot be directly measured and must instead be estimated or inferred. Asteroseismology—the study of stellar pulsations—is one of the most promising methods for inferring stellar ages, but its accuracy depends heavily on the theoretical stellar models used, which suffer from poorly characterised uncertainties. We have quantified systematic age uncertainties for 1.5-2.5 Msun delta Scuti stars. To support this, we present a comprehensive grid of 60 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA and GYRE codes. In contrast to previous work, such as [Murphy et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13142), our models incorporate four key advancements: uniform rotation; an extended age range; an extension of mode degrees up to ell=3; and the inclusion of g-modes, mixed modes, and their avoided crossings. We examine the effects of key physical parameters, such as convective overshoot, mixing length alpha, and nuclear reaction networks, on the stellar pulsation frequencies. This grid and the associated systematic uncertainty study will be made available to the community. Its first application will be to refine the age of the Pleiades.

analourdes.jurezgarca@hdr.mq.edu.au	Ana Lourdes	Juarez Garcia	Macquarie University	Student	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks in X-ray binary progenitors		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	To have a better understanding of the progenitors in X-ray binaries (specially low-mass and intermediate mass X-ray binaries), we need to consider the dynamics and outcomes of the steps that both stars in the binary go through in their respective and combined (interacting) evolutions. One important phase is the formation of an accretion disk via mass transfer, after the primary has already become a neutron star and the companion has become a giant that transfers mass to the neutron star. This happens before the system goes into common envelope (CE) phase. We need to understand the formation, evolution and longevity of the disk and what the impact of the disk (and possible jets) is on the CE phase that follows. So far analytical studies of the mass transfer phase, and a handful of hydrodynamic simulations (including global CE simulations) attempt to answer these questions but with very poor results. I present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of an accretion disk around a 1.4 Mo, NS in an intermediate mass X-ray binary with a 7 Mo red supergiant using a grid and an SPH code. I show the mass transfer phase is more complex than assumed and I constrain the disk parameters including size, mass, scale height and longevity.		
amanda.karakas@monash.edu	Amanda	Karakas	Monash University	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Bespoke models of AGB and post-AGB stars		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	New observations of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars are challenging our understanding of the evolution of low and intermediate-mass stars. Gaia-derived luminosities of S-type AGB stars are particularly interesting in this regard. S-type stars are thought to be showing the first signs of third dredge-up mixing, and are good candidates for calibrating models. However the luminosity of an AGB star does not provide a unique initial (or current) stellar mass, owing to the core-mass luminosity relationship which is degenerate for stars less than 2 solar masses. In this talk I summarise our efforts to derive the initial masses of S-type AGB stars from their stellar pulsations. Surveys of post-AGB stars in the LMC and SMC have also discovered objects with surface compositions showing large enrichments in carbon and elements heavier than iron. Some of these post-AGB stars have luminosities that are lower than predicted by carbon-rich AGB models, making them challenging to explain. In this talk I present the results of new stellar evolutionary models designed to reproduce observations of low-luminosity AGB and post-AGB stars, including their heavy-element surface compositions.

Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The Birth of Sh 2-208: How Feedback from the Open Star Cluster Waterloo 01 Shapes the Formation of a Young H II Region.		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No		Young open clusters (age ≤10 Myr) are idiosyncratic to study star formation in our galaxy. It is important to study the properties of young open clusters in order to understand how star formation takes place in both local and Galactic plane scale. Moreover, young clusters offer the smallest physical scale over which meaningful determination of the stellar IMF can be made. Apart from this, one of the important question in the field of star formation is the role of stellar feedback on the subsequent star formation process. The evolution of HII regions can trigger a new generation of stars at their peripheries, with environmental conditions that may affect the IMF, disk evolution and star formation efficiency. In this work, using multi-wavelength data sets we study the stellar content and feedback-driven formation of Young H II Region Sh 2-208. We also studied the role of Open Star Cluster Waterloo 01 in Shaping Sh 2-208.		
s.martell@unsw.edu.au	Sarah	Martell	UNSW	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The abundance fingerprints of escaped globular cluster stars in GALAH		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Light-element abundance anomalies in globular clusters are a classic observational mystery. Whilst roughly half of the stars in each cluster have scaled Solar abundance patterns, the other half are depleted in carbon, oxygen and magnesium and enhanced in nitrogen, sodium and aluminium, and a comprehensive and realistic explanation for this phenomenon has not yet been found. Even if we don't completely understand globular cluster abundance anomalies, we can make use of them. There are no other environments in the Galaxy where this abundance pattern is common, so it is a relatively unique and reliable chemical tag to identify stars that originally formed in globular clusters and subsequently escaped. The latest GALAH data release includes carbon and nitrogen abundances for the first time, so I am investigating how well the different abundances perform at identifying globular cluster escapees, whether they agree, and what the optimal chemical tag is for these stars in GALAH DR4.		
kayla.martin@students.mq.edu.au	Kayla	Martin	Macquarie University	Student	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The impact of accretion on post-AGB binary star evolution		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Post-AGB stars in binaries have quickly become a topic of much interest, largely due to their observed peculiar surface chemistry and unique wide range of orbital periods (~100-2000 days) and eccentricities (0 to ~0.6). Post-AGB stars are often found dancing in orbit with a main sequence companion and are further observed to be surrounded by a dusty circumbinary disk. These objects have recently left the turbulent AGB phase after experiencing significant, rapid mass-loss driven by binary interaction. The exact evolutionary pathway and mechanisms responsible for producing the observational properties of these systems remains unclear, and clearly deviates from classical binary evolution scenarios. In this study, we use the open-source 1D stellar evolution code MESA to simulate the accretion of metal-poor gas from a circumbinary disk onto an evolving post-AGB star, to examine the formation of chemical depletion patterns in post-AGB star photospheres. Further, we explore the impact of accretion on the structural evolution of post-AGB stars, as well as the timescale of post-AGB evolution, which may have important consequences on the formation of complex planetary nebulae.		
maksym.mohorian@students.mq.edu.au	Maksym	Mohorian	Macquarie University	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Chemical depletion in evolved binaries with second-generation protoplanetary discs		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	Binary interaction significantly influences the chemical evolution of low- and intermediate-mass (LIM) stars, a phenomenon integral to our understanding of evolved stars. Within this framework, post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars (of A, F, G, and K spectral types) with circumbinary discs exhibit intriguing photospheric chemical depletion, notably marked by a depletion of refractory elements (e.g., Al, Fe, Ti, s-process elements) relative to volatile elements (e.g., S, Zn, Na, K). The underlying mechanism driving this depletion remains not yet fully understood, but it likely stems from the chemical fractionation of gas and dust within the circumbinary disc, followed by the re-accretion of pristine gas onto the primary star. Recent observational studies have shown that these circumbinary discs are similar to the protoplanetary discs (PPDs) around young stars in terms of infrared excess, keplerian rotation, and dust mineralogy. Notably, a subset of post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosts “transition” discs characterised by large inner cavities similar to those observed in PPDs, suggesting the potential presence of a giant planet carving a hole in the disc. To further investigate the chemical depletion process in these targets, we conducted a detailed chemical abundance analysis of all known transition disc systems, totaling 12 in both the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud (characterised by moderate-to-high mid-infrared excess and substantial depletion efficiency [S/Ti] > 1.3 dex). We used high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT to study how chemical depletion correlates with various parameters from both the host star (e.g., photometric, orbital, pulsational) and the disc (orientation, size, morphology). We confirmed that depletion efficiency in transition disc systems is higher than in other evolved binary stars. Additionally, we found that the derived chemical depletion patterns in our evolved binary systems are matching those observed in young planet-hosting stars and are mostly in line with those observed in interstellar medium. We also found that the pulsation period of our targets is strongly anti-correlated with the infrared luminosity produced by the circumbinary disc. In this talk, I will present these interesting highlights of our study and also the implications of our results on possible planet formation in evolved binary stars.		
chunliang.mu@hdr.mq.edu.au	Chunliang	Mu	Macquarie University	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Light curves of 3D Common Envelope Simulations		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	The common envelope (CE) binary interaction happens when two stars’ come so close that their envelopes merge. This typically takes place when one of the two stars expands on its journey to becoming a giant. Typically the more compact of the two stars experience a (gravitational) drag force at the hand of the envelope of the larger star, which leads to either the complete ejection of the common envelope, or to the companion merging with the primary. CEs are thought to be the main mechanism to form compact evolved binaries such as the neutron star binaries, NS-black-hole or binary black holes that can merge and generate observable gravitational waves. It is entirely plausible that the transients named luminous red novae are common envelope interactions caught in the act. 3D simulations are required to quantify the CE physical mechanism, due to the complex asymmetric nature of CE evolution. To constrain the simulations and make them effective tools to explain observations, we need to predict light curves. Here I present the first light curve results of our SPH-based 3D numerical CE simulations, including an assessment of the uncertainty and future steps.

Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Common envelopes are a phenomenon that is well studied in the context of two stars. However, a common envelope can also be created from the interaction between a star and an orbiting planet. This talk aims to explore what happens when a common envelope is created from a star engulfing an orbiting giant planet, in particular what happens to the star and the ejected stellar material after the interaction. In addition, the fate of the planet and details regarding the observation of such planetary engulfments will be also be discussed.		
jack.nibbs@hdr.mq.edu.au	Jack	Nibbs	Macquarie University	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Disc construction through common envelope evolution		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	The common envelope phase of binary stellar evolution is a crucial part of explaining many phenomena, from x-ray binaries, luminous red novae, and short period binaries. All classic post-common envelope binaries have very short orbital periods, a feature that is relatively well understood within the framework of the CE inspiral. On the other hand, a class of post-red and asymptotic giant branch systems (post-RGB and post-AGB) appear to have wider separations, but also small enough that a common envelope interaction must have taken place. These systems always have a large, low mass circumbinary disk. I present scenarios to form large, circumbinary disks that form either as fallback of material that remains bound to the binary after the a CE interaction, or that are created by a weaker, ‘glancing’, interaction. My research explores the regime that must exist between a classical common envelope with its extreme in-spiral and a `glancing' common envelope with a reduced in-spiral, by using 3D hydrodynamic simulations of both discs and the common envelope phase itself, as a two-pronged approach, to probe this intermediate regime and explain post-RGB and AGB binaries and related objects such as barium stars, CEMP stars and other post-interaction objects.		
may.pedersen@sydney.edu.au	May Gade	Pedersen	University of Sydney	Postdoctoral Researcher (fixed term position)	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Probing time dependent convective boundary mixing with gravity mode oscillations		Talk	No, but I would like to register for Stars in Brisbane now if I can?	Yes	N/A	One of the dominant uncertainties in the evolution of stars with convective cores arises from their poorly constrained internal mixing properties. Such mixing can renew the hydrogen fuel in the stellar cores, thereby significantly extending their main-sequence lifetimes and increasing the final helium core mass obtained at core hydrogen exhaustion. Different mixing processes occurring near the convective boundaries are collectively referred to as convective boundary mixing (CBM). Their implementation in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes generally rely on at least one free parameter that defines the extent and mixing efficiency in this region. One such type of CBM is convective penetration. Recently, 3D numerical simulations of convective penetration occurring at the boundary of convective cores suggest that the extent of this CBM region can be directly computed from the properties of the core and changes size as the star evolves. Here we investigate if gravity mode oscillations, which have the highest probing power near the convective core, are sensitive to such time dependent CBM and if such mixing is sufficient to explain the gravity mode oscillations observed in Slowly Pulsating B stars.		
n.rsegovia@unsw.edu.au	NIcolas	Rodriguez-Segovia	UNSW Canberra	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Sub-dwarf B stars with COMPAS and MESA		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars are low-mass stars that have a thin outer hydrogen layer and helium-burning interior, usually corresponding to the exposed cores of stars near the tip of the red giant branch. However, the process through which they lose most of their hydrogen rich envelope is not completely clear. Amongst possible formation scenarios, binary evolution is the most accepted, encompassing both stable and unstable mass transfer as well as mergers. To have a better understanding of the characteristics of these different formation channels and the current-day sdB population, we use the rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) code COMPAS (Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics and Statistics) to investigate production pathways of these low-mass stars for the first time. We also adapt results from detailed modelling of sdBs with MESA from the literature, apply them to our population synthesis results and further improve the estimates about the physical properties of our population. We discuss our results by comparing them against previous studies available in the literature, highlight agreement with observables and propose potential applications.		
han.shen5@unsw.edu.au	Han	Shen	UNSW	Student	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Using population synthesis to resolve the origins of lithium-rich giant stars		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	This project will combine GALAH data with other sources, primarily LAMOST, to create the most comprehensive catalogue of lithium-rich giant stars. I will use my previous experience with machine learning and spectra to identify previously unknown lithium-rich giants. I will develop a comprehensive population synthesis model for RGB and red clump stars that will make it possible to test whether the various mechanisms proposed in the literature are actually responsible for the high lithium abundances in these stars.		
d.stello@unsw.edu.au	Dennis	Stello	UNSW	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	The Kepler Ultra Deep Field		Talk	Signed up for Stars+Exo, but would have to leave Wed eve, so cant attend the dinner either.	No	N/A	Over the past decade, the Kepler mission has been revolutionising our knowledge about stars in the Galactic disk. This is because Kepler’s photometric data of unprecedented quality, can reveal tiny variations in stellar brightness caused by standing sound wave oscillations inside stars. Every half hour over 4 years, Kepler recorded images of its fixed field of view, which were downlinked to Earth. Photometric data from the images was initially produced only for the 200,000 mission targets, mostly bright near-by disk stars. This left all non-targeted stars in the images unutilized. Crucially though, NASA created in late 2023 the photometric data for all 400,000 non-target stars that were serendipitously observed; with the same quality as the original targets. These new ‘Kepler-Bonus’ data are dominated by much fainter – hence more distant – stars. In this presentation I will show that the data will give us detections to measure oscillations in red giant stars out to hundreds of kilo parsec – essentially to the ‘edge’ of the Galaxy – making this the only data in the foreseeable future to investigate the most pristine part of the Galaxy with such high fidelity.		
mark.walker@manlyastrophysics.org	Mark	Walker	Manly Astrophysics	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Winds, disruptions and accretion in R Coronae Borealis		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	Luminous stars can drive fast dust-winds from the surfaces of hydrogen snow clouds, leading to deep eclipses lasting for several months when a cloud's orbit takes it within a few AU of the star. Such close interactions involve tidal disruption of the cloud, with the star accreting helium as a result. This scenario provides a simple account of the dimming events of R Coronae Borealis stars, and simultaneously explains why these events occur specifically in hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants: as fast as it accretes, the helium is burnt on the surface of a degenerate core. By way of contrast we will show eclipse light-curves for systems where the luminosity is moderate or low, as would be expected for a non-degenerate disruptor/accretor. We also identify the source of the observed chromospheric emission lines and near-/mid-IR excess flux, in the context of this disruption/accretion model of RCBs.		
jacinda.webb@students.mq.edu.au	jacinda	webb	Macquarie University	Student	Woman	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Hierarchical Star Formation in Messier 17		Poster	Yes, I have already registered		N/A	We investigate the hierarchical architecture of star formation across Messier 17, the Omega Nebula, using Gaussian kernels and two-dimensional binning statistics. We explore the clustering properties and stellar luminosity functions of the young, main-sequence stellar populations. Our analysis allows us to conclude that the observed hierarchy is driven by supersonic turbulence, as evidenced by the fitted fractal dimensions via $\chi^2$ optimisation of the clustering size distributions. With respect to previous studies, we identify a smaller extent of star-forming hierarchy in Messier 17, distinguishing it from older, more developed regions like the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds on galaxy-wide scales.		
ryan.white@uq.edu.au	Ryan	White	University of Queensland	Student	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	JWST Imaging of Colliding Wind Nebulae and the GRB Progenitor Apep		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	Yes	N/A	Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the powerful and beautiful end-of-life stages of the most massive stars. In their final throes, they enrich the interstellar medium with carbon and heavy elements before finally undergoing core-collapse supernova. Most massive stars evolve in pairs, and so handful of these WR stars interact with another massive stellar companion and produce quickly evolving spiral dust nebulae in what is called a colliding wind binary. I spend my time developing and fitting fast geometric models to these nebulae, which uniquely reveal the sensitive orbital and stellar physics happening beyond our view. With new JWST images being revealed of these systems, we can use our models on these unique stellar laboratories to probe the physics of massive binary evolution in a phase right before supernova, and potentially shed light on the roles of WR+O/WR systems as gamma-ray burst progenitors.		
daniel.zucker@mq.edu.au	Daniel	Zucker	Macquarie University	Faculty/Staff (continuing position)	Man	Stars in Brisbane ONLY	Crossing the Streams: The S5 Survey’s View of the Galactic Halo		Talk	Yes, I have already registered	No	N/A	Large galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, with smaller systems merging and accreting to form increasingly massive structures. Evidence for this process can be found all around us: dynamically, as stellar overdensities in phase space in the nearby Galaxy; chemically, in the form of abundance patterns distinct from those of stars which formed in situ within the Milky Way; and spatially, in the form of stellar streams and tidally disrupting satellites in the Galactic halo. This last domain – a halo dramatically criss-crossed by an abundance of stellar substructures – is the focus of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5), an Australian-led international collaboration using the AAT + AAOmega to study the streams and disrupting satellites surrounding the Milky Way. Its science goals include characterising the Galaxy’s accretion history and constraining the distribution of matter interior to stream orbits. Among the science results I will discuss are evidence for the influence of the LMC on halo stream orbits (and the Milky Way itself), the orbital properties of the stellar streams observed, and comparisons with simulation predictions for detectable streams and satellites. I will conclude with a look at the prospects of new facilities such as LSST and 4MOST for driving major advances in our understanding of how galaxies like the Milky Way grow.
